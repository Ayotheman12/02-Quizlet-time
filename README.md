Unit 4 homework was to build and online quiz by manipulating the DOM. The user answers a series of multiple choice questions. If a wrong answer is given time is deducted from the amount of time remaining. At the end of the quiz the userâ€™s final time (score) and initials are logged. Participants are ranked according to their score. No starter code was given. I had to build the html, css and js files. This project utilized and increased my knowledge of: event listeners, timers/intervals and interval clears, text content, local storage, and query selectors.
